This blog is a place to play around **Next.js** and other things.

## Highlights

- MDX for dynamic routes
- HMR with `next-remote-watch` for POSTS (not guarrented to work yet)
- Use CJK Source/Noto typeface. Which are pretty heavy.

I used the following references to setup this blog:

- https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown
- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote
